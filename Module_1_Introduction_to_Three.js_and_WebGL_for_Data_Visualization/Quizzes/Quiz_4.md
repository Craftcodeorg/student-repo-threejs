### Quiz Questions ###

1. **QUESTION 1**: What is the primary role of the camera in a Three.js scene?
   - A) To process vertex data into pixel data
   - B) To determine the perspective from which the scene is viewed
   - C) To apply textures to objects in the scene
   - D) To merge output fragments into a final image
   - **Correct Answer**: B) To determine the perspective from which the scene is viewed

2. **QUESTION 2**: How does the camera impact the rendering process in a Three.js scene?
   - A) It optimizes the rendering by clipping unseen objects
   - B) It sets the field of view, aspect ratio, and rendering distance
   - C) It converts geometric data into pixels
   - D) It applies color and texture to fragments
   - **Correct Answer**: B) It sets the field of view, aspect ratio, and rendering distance

3. **QUESTION 3**: In the context of a Three.js scene, why is setting up the camera correctly important for data visualization?
   - A) It ensures that all vertices are transformed into 3D space correctly
   - B) It enhances the aesthetic quality by applying textures
   - C) It ensures that the visualized data is viewed from the correct perspective and scale
   - D) It determines which parts of the scene are visible through clipping
   - **Correct Answer**: C) It ensures that the visualized data is viewed from the correct perspective and scale

### Quiz Purpose ###

- This quiz is designed to reinforce the learnerâ€™s understanding of the content from the lecture "Understanding the Rendering Pipeline." The questions focus on the role of the camera in a Three.js scene, a critical aspect of setting up effective and efficient data visualizations. By understanding how the camera functions within the rendering pipeline, learners will be better equipped to create visually accurate and performant web-based applications, aligning with their career goals in Data Engineering and Full-Stack Development.
