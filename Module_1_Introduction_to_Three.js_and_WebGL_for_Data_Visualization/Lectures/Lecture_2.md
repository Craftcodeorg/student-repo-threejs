#### 3. Core Concepts:

**a. Understanding Three.js:**
   - **What is Three.js?**: A JavaScript library that simplifies the process of creating 3D graphics in a web browser using WebGL.
   - **Why use Three.js?**: It abstracts the complexities of WebGL, making it easier to create sophisticated visualizations.

**b. Setting Up the Environment:**
   - **Installation**: You can include Three.js in your project via a CDN or by downloading it from the official website.
   - **Basic Project Structure**: Create an HTML file with a `<script>` tag to include Three.js. Set up a basic folder structure for your assets and scripts.

**c. Creating Your First Scene:**
   - **Components of a Scene**: A scene in Three.js typically includes a camera, renderer, and objects.
   - **Basic Code Setup**:
     ```html
     <html>
     <head>
       <title>Three.js Setup</title>
     </head>
     <body>
       <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r128/three.min.js"></script>
       <script>
         const scene = new THREE.Scene();
         const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
         const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
         renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
         document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

         // Add a cube
         const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
         const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});
         const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
         scene.add(cube);

         camera.position.z = 5;
         
         function animate() {
           requestAnimationFrame(animate);
           cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
           cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
           renderer.render(scene, camera);
         }
         animate();
       </script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This code sets up a simple rotating cube in a Three.js scene, demonstrating the basic setup and rendering process.

#### 4. Practical Application:

**Example 1: Financial Data Visualization**
   - Use Three.js to visualize stock market data as dynamic 3D graphs, allowing users to interact with data points for detailed analysis.

**Example 2: Geospatial Visualization**
   - Implement Three.js to render complex geospatial datasets in 3D, providing an interactive map experience for users to explore geographical data.

---

#### 5. Summary:

In this lecture, you learned how to set up a basic Three.js environment, which is foundational for developing interactive 3D visualizations. You explored the essential components needed to create and render a scene, such as the camera, renderer, and objects like a cube. These skills are vital for your journey as a Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer, enabling you to create compelling data visualizations.

#### 6. Next Steps:

In the next lecture, we will delve into "Working with Geometries and Materials in Three.js," where you'll learn how to create more complex shapes and apply different materials to enhance your visualizations. To prepare, review this lecture's code example and experiment with changing parameters like colors and shapes to familiarize yourself with the rendering process.
