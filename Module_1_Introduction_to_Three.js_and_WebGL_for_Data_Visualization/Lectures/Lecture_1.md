#### 3. Core Concepts

- **What is WebGL?**
  - WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. It leverages the power of the GPU, making it ideal for real-time data visualization.

- **Introduction to Three.js**
  - Three.js is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies the use of WebGL by providing an easy-to-use interface for creating and displaying animated 3D graphics in a web browser. It abstracts the complexity of WebGL, allowing developers to focus on creative aspects rather than technical details.

- **Key Features of Three.js**
  - **Scene Graph**: Organizes objects in a hierarchy, making it easier to manage complex visualizations.
  - **Materials and Textures**: Enhance visual realism by simulating different surface properties.
  - **Lighting and Shadows**: Create depth and realism in your visualizations with various lighting techniques.

- **Relevance to Data Visualization**
  - Three.js and WebGL allow for the creation of interactive and engaging visual representations of data, which are crucial for data-driven decision-making processes.

#### 4. Practical Application

- **Example: Stock Market Visualization**
  - Imagine a dashboard where users can explore stock market trends in real-time. Using Three.js, you can create a 3D graph that dynamically updates with live data, providing users with an intuitive understanding of market movements.

```javascript
// Simple Three.js code snippet to create a rotating cube
var scene = new THREE.Scene();
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth/window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00});
var cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

camera.position.z = 5;

var animate = function () {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
};

animate();
```

- **Industry Use Case: Geospatial Data Visualization**
  - Companies like Mapbox use WebGL to render complex geospatial data efficiently, enabling users to interact with large-scale maps seamlessly.
