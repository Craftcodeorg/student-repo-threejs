### Lecture: Creating Simple 3D Objects and Scenes

---

#### 1. **Learning Objectives**:
   - Understand the basic components of a 3D scene in Three.js.
   - Learn how to create simple 3D objects like cubes and spheres.
   - Gain the ability to manipulate these objects and create a basic interactive scene.

#### 2. **Introduction**:
   In this lecture, we will delve into the creation of simple 3D objects and scenes using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library that leverages WebGL. As a Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer, mastering these skills will enable you to craft visually compelling data visualizations that can enhance user interaction and engagement. By integrating 3D objects into your web applications, you can provide unique insights into complex datasets, making them more accessible and understandable.

#### 3. **Core Concepts**:
   - **Understanding 3D Objects**: In Three.js, 3D objects are created using geometries and materials. Geometries define the shape, while materials define the appearance.
     - **Basic Geometries**: Learn to create basic shapes like `BoxGeometry`, `SphereGeometry`, and `PlaneGeometry`.
     - **Materials**: Explore different material types such as `MeshBasicMaterial` and `MeshPhongMaterial` to give your objects color and texture.
   
   - **Creating a Scene**: A scene is where all the objects, lights, and cameras are placed. It acts as a container for everything you want to render.
     - **Adding Objects to the Scene**: Use `scene.add(object)` to include your 3D objects in the scene.
     - **Positioning and Rotating Objects**: Learn how to set the position (`object.position.set(x, y, z)`) and rotation (`object.rotation.set(x, y, z)`) of your objects.

#### 4. **Practical Application**:
   - **Real-World Example**: In financial applications, creating a 3D bar chart can visually represent stock market data over time. This makes it easier for users to identify trends and anomalies.
   - **Code Snippet**:
     ```javascript
     const scene = new THREE.Scene();
     const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
     const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
     const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
     scene.add(cube);
     cube.position.set(2, 1, -5);
     ```

#### 5. **Summary**:
   In this lecture, you learned how to create basic 3D objects using Three.js and how to assemble them into a scene. You also explored how these skills can be applied in data visualization, particularly in creating interactive visual tools that can simplify complex data interpretation. These foundational skills are crucial as you advance in creating more sophisticated visualizations that can significantly enhance user experience in web-based applications.

#### 6. **Next Steps**:
   Our next lecture will focus on adding interactivity to your scenes, allowing users to engage with your visualizations dynamically. To prepare, review the concepts of event listeners in JavaScript as they will be integral to creating interactive elements in your scenes. Additionally, experiment with different geometries and materials to familiarize yourself with their properties and effects.
