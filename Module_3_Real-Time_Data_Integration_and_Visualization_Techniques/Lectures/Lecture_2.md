### Lecture: Using APIs for Data Retrieval (RESTful and WebSockets)

#### 1. Learning Objectives:
- Understand the fundamental differences between RESTful APIs and WebSockets.
- Learn how to retrieve real-time data using both RESTful APIs and WebSockets.
- Gain practical skills in implementing API calls for data visualization projects.

#### 2. Introduction:
APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are crucial tools for data engineers and full-stack developers, enabling seamless data retrieval and integration into applications. This lecture focuses on RESTful APIs and WebSockets, two prominent methods for accessing real-time data. As a budding data engineer and full-stack developer, mastering these techniques will enhance your ability to build dynamic, data-driven applications that cater to your interests in data visualization, stock market analysis, and interactive dashboards.

#### 3. Core Concepts:

- **RESTful APIs**:
  - **Definition**: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests for communication.
  - **Key Features**: Stateless operations, use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and resource-based URL structure.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where data updates are less frequent or can be polled periodically.

- **WebSockets**:
  - **Definition**: A protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
  - **Key Features**: Persistent connection, low latency, suitable for real-time data updates.
  - **Use Case**: Best for applications requiring real-time updates, such as live sports scores or stock market tickers.

#### 4. Practical Application:

- **Example 1: Stock Market Dashboard**:
  - Use RESTful APIs to fetch historical stock data for visualization.
  - Implement WebSockets to stream live stock prices, ensuring the dashboard reflects the latest market conditions.
  - **Code Snippet**:
    ```javascript
    // Example using WebSocket for real-time stock updates
    const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example-stock-api.com/live');
    socket.onmessage = function(event) {
      const stockData = JSON.parse(event.data);
      updateDashboard(stockData);
    };
    ```

- **Example 2: Global News Visualization**:
  - Use RESTful APIs to retrieve news articles based on geolocation or topic.
  - Employ WebSockets to push breaking news alerts to users in real-time.

#### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, you learned the differences between RESTful APIs and WebSockets and their applications in real-time data retrieval. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing responsive and interactive applications, such as stock market dashboards and news visualization tools. These skills are essential for your career progression as a data engineer and full-stack developer.

#### 6. Next Steps:
In the next lecture, we will explore "Building Interactive Dashboards with Real-Time Data". To prepare, review your notes on RESTful APIs and WebSockets, and consider experimenting with a simple API call using both methods. This will reinforce your understanding and readiness for the upcoming topic on integrating these techniques into interactive dashboards.
