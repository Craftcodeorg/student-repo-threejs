#### 2. Introduction:

In the fast-paced world of data engineering and full-stack development, the ability to transform and process data efficiently is crucial. Data transformation involves converting raw data into a more usable format, while processing involves manipulating this data to extract valuable insights. This lecture is designed to equip you with the essential skills needed to handle real-time data, a key aspect of your journey towards becoming a proficient Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer. These skills are particularly relevant to your interests in data visualization, stock market analysis, and building interactive dashboards.

#### 3. Core Concepts:

- **Data Transformation**:
  - **Definition**: The process of converting data from one format or structure into another.
  - **Techniques**:
    - **Normalization**: Adjusting values measured on different scales to a common scale.
    - **Aggregation**: Summarizing data to provide insights at a higher level.
    - **Data Cleaning**: Removing inaccuracies and inconsistencies to improve data quality.

- **Data Processing**:
  - **Batch Processing**: Handling large volumes of data in groups or batches at scheduled times.
  - **Stream Processing**: Real-time processing of data as it flows into the system, essential for applications like stock market analysis.
  - **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: A critical process for integrating data from various sources into a single repository.

- **Tools and Technologies**:
  - **Apache Kafka**: For building real-time streaming data pipelines.
  - **Apache Spark**: For large-scale data processing and analytics.

#### 4. Practical Application:

- **Real-World Example**: 
  - In financial applications, real-time data processing is crucial for updating stock prices on dashboards. Data from multiple sources is transformed and aggregated to provide up-to-the-minute insights for traders.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```javascript
  // Example of a simple transformation using JavaScript
  const rawData = [ { price: '100.5', volume: '200' }, { price: '101.2', volume: '150' } ];
  
  const transformedData = rawData.map(data => ({
      price: parseFloat(data.price),
      volume: parseInt(data.volume)
  }));

  console.log(transformedData);
  // Output: [{ price: 100.5, volume: 200 }, { price: 101.2, volume: 150 }]
  ```
