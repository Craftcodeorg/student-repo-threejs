### Quiz Questions ###

1. **QUESTION 1**: How can RESTful APIs be used to integrate real-time data into a Three.js visualization?
   - A) By establishing a persistent connection for continuous data updates.
   - B) By periodically polling data updates using HTTP requests.
   - C) By using a single TCP connection for full-duplex communication.
   - D) By pushing data updates directly to the client without requests.
   - **Correct Answer**: B) By periodically polling data updates using HTTP requests.

2. **QUESTION 2**: What is the primary advantage of using WebSockets over RESTful APIs for integrating real-time data in Three.js visualizations?
   - A) WebSockets allow for stateless operations.
   - B) WebSockets support standard HTTP methods like GET and POST.
   - C) WebSockets provide a persistent connection with low latency.
   - D) WebSockets are ideal for infrequent data updates.
   - **Correct Answer**: C) WebSockets provide a persistent connection with low latency.

3. **QUESTION 3**: In the context of a Three.js visualization, which scenario is most suitable for using WebSockets?
   - A) Displaying static historical data.
   - B) Visualizing data that updates once a day.
   - C) Streaming live updates of stock prices.
   - D) Fetching data from multiple resources periodically.
   - **Correct Answer**: C) Streaming live updates of stock prices.
