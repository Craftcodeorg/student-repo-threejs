### Quiz Purpose ###

- This quiz is designed to reinforce the learnerâ€™s understanding of the content from the lecture "Accessing and Integrating Real-Time Data Sources." It focuses on distinguishing between RESTful APIs and WebSockets, particularly in terms of communication style, data handling, and use case suitability. These questions aim to ensure learners can apply this knowledge in practical scenarios relevant to Data Visualization, Data Engineering, and Full-Stack Development. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the appropriate technology when integrating real-time data into web applications.
