### Quiz Questions ###

1. **QUESTION 1**: 
   - A) APIs are only used for fetching data, not updating it.
   - B) APIs can be used to fetch and update data in real time by sending requests to a server and receiving responses.
   - C) APIs require manual data entry to fetch and update data in real time.
   - D) APIs automatically visualize data without the need for additional tools.
   - **Correct Answer**: B) APIs can be used to fetch and update data in real time by sending requests to a server and receiving responses.

2. **QUESTION 2**: 
   - A) RESTful APIs are not suitable for real-time data integration.
   - B) WebSockets are preferred over RESTful APIs for real-time updates because they allow continuous data streams.
   - C) RESTful APIs and WebSockets cannot be used together in real-time applications.
   - D) WebSockets are only used for static data visualization.
   - **Correct Answer**: B) WebSockets are preferred over RESTful APIs for real-time updates because they allow continuous data streams.

3. **QUESTION 3**: 
   - A) Real-time data visualization is not useful for decision-making processes.
   - B) Real-time data visualization only applies to financial markets.
   - C) Real-time data visualization enhances decision-making by providing immediate insights from live data feeds.
   - D) Real-time data visualization requires no integration techniques.
   - **Correct Answer**: C) Real-time data visualization enhances decision-making by providing immediate insights from live data feeds.

### Quiz Purpose ###

- This quiz is designed to reinforce the learnerâ€™s understanding of how APIs can be used to fetch and update data in real time, as covered in the lecture "Case Studies on Real-Time Data Visualization Applications". It aims to ensure that learners can apply this knowledge in practical scenarios relevant to Data Visualization, Data Engineering, and Full-Stack Development. The questions focus on the use of APIs, the role of WebSockets in real-time applications, and the importance of real-time visualizations in decision-making processes.
