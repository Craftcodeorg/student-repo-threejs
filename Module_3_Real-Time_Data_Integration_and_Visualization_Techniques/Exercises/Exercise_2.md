## Module Title: Real-Time Data Integration and Visualization Techniques

### Exercise 2: Implement WebSocket Communication for Real-Time Updates

#### Problem Statement:
As a data engineer and full-stack developer interested in building interactive data visualizations and financial analysis tools, your task is to create a real-time stock market dashboard. This dashboard should display live stock prices using WebSockets, enabling it to update automatically as new data becomes available. You will integrate WebSocket communication to stream live data and ensure that the dashboard reflects the latest market conditions.

#### Learning Objectives:
- Apply WebSocket communication for real-time data updates.
- Integrate live data streams into a web application.
- Enhance your understanding of dynamic data-driven application development.

#### Scenario:
Imagine you are developing a web-based application that visualizes stock market trends. You have already set up the basic structure using RESTful APIs for historical data. Now, your goal is to implement WebSockets to handle real-time updates, providing users with an up-to-the-minute view of stock price changes.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
```javascript
// Starter code for implementing WebSocket communication in a stock market dashboard

// Establish a WebSocket connection to the stock market API
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example-stock-api.com/live');

// Function to update the dashboard with new stock data
function updateDashboard(stockData) {
    // Log the received data for debugging purposes
    console.log("Received stock data: ", stockData);

    // Update the HTML elements with the new stock prices
    document.getElementById('stock-price').innerText = _______;
    document.getElementById('stock-change').innerText = _______;
}

// Event listener for receiving messages from the WebSocket server
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    // Parse the incoming JSON data
    const stockData = JSON.parse(event.data);

    // Call the function to update the dashboard
    updateDashboard(_______);
};

// Handle WebSocket errors
socket.onerror = function(error) {
    console.error('WebSocket Error: ', error);
};

// Close the WebSocket connection when the window is closed
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    socket.close();
};
```

#### Hints:
1. **Parsing Data**: Remember that WebSockets send data in string format. Use `JSON.parse()` to convert it into a JavaScript object.
2. **Updating UI**: Ensure that you correctly reference the properties of the parsed object to update the HTML elements.
3. **Error Handling**: Consider implementing additional checks to handle any unexpected errors or data formats.

#### Expected Outcome:
Upon completing this exercise, you should have a functional real-time stock market dashboard that updates automatically with new stock prices. Your solution should demonstrate an understanding of WebSocket communication, including establishing connections, handling incoming messages, and updating the user interface dynamically. Additionally, your code should include error handling and be well-commented to explain each step clearly.

### Integration:
- Ensure all code snippets are properly formatted and include comments for clarity.
- Provide any necessary resources or links to documentation that may assist in understanding WebSocket implementation.
- Structure the content with clear headings and sections for easy navigation within the learning platform.

By completing this exercise, you will enhance your skills in integrating real-time data streams into web applications, aligning with your career goals in Data Engineering and Full-Stack Development.
