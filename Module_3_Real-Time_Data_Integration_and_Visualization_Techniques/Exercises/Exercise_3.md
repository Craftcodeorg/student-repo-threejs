### Exercise 3: Visualize Real-Time Data Using Three.js Animations

#### Problem Statement:
In this exercise, you will apply the concepts learned in the lecture on "Visualizing Real-Time Data with Three.js" to create an interactive web-based globe that visualizes real-time world news. Your task is to set up a Three.js environment, integrate a real-time data feed using a news API, and animate the data on a 3D globe. This exercise will enhance your skills in using Three.js for data visualization, specifically focusing on integrating real-time data and creating interactive visual elements.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
Below is the starter code to help you begin your project. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```javascript
// Import necessary Three.js modules
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Basic setup
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create a globe
const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(5, 32, 32);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0077ff, wireframe: true });
const globe = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(globe);

// Position the camera
camera.position.z = 10;

// Function to fetch and update real-time news data
async function fetchNewsData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/news'); // Replace with a valid news API
        const data = await response.json();
        updateGlobe(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching news data:', error);
    }
}

// Function to update the globe with real-time news data
function updateGlobe(data) {
    // Logic to update globe based on real-time news data
    // For example, add markers or change colors based on news categories
}

// Animation loop
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    globe.rotation.y += 0.01; // Rotate the globe for visual effect
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

// Start fetching data and animation
fetchNewsData();
animate();
```

#### Hints:
1. **Setting Up Three.js**: Ensure you have included the Three.js library in your project. You can use a CDN or install it via npm.
2. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Use the Fetch API or Axios to retrieve data from a real-time news API. Ensure you handle any potential errors with try-catch blocks.
3. **Updating Visuals**: Think about how you can visually represent different types of news on the globe. Consider using different colors or markers for various news categories.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Keep the animations smooth by optimizing how often you fetch and update data.

#### Expected Outcome:
By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your ability to set up a Three.js environment and integrate real-time data into a 3D visualization. The final solution should include:
- A rotating globe displaying real-time news data.
- Visual markers or color changes on the globe to represent different news categories.
- Proper error handling for data fetching.
- Well-commented code explaining each step of your implementation.

This exercise aligns with the student's career goals and interests by focusing on building an interactive web-based application that visualizes real-time data, specifically world news. It encourages hands-on practice with Three.js and integrates real-time data sources, which are critical skills for a Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer.
