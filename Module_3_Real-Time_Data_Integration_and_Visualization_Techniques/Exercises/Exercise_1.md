## Exercise 1: Set up a RESTful API Connection to Retrieve Data

### Problem Statement

As an aspiring Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer, you are tasked with building a real-time news aggregation platform that displays the latest world news on an interactive web-based globe. To achieve this, you need to set up a RESTful API connection to retrieve news data. Your goal is to fetch live news updates from a public API, such as the NewsAPI, and integrate this data into your application.

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Objective**: 
   - Establish a connection to a RESTful API to fetch real-time news data.
   - Parse the retrieved JSON data and display the headlines on your web application.
   - Ensure the application updates dynamically as new data becomes available.

2. **Tools and Technologies**:
   - Use Node.js for server-side operations.
   - Utilize Axios for making HTTP requests to the API.
   - Implement JavaScript for processing and displaying data on the client-side.

3. **Task**:
   - Connect to the NewsAPI using Axios.
   - Fetch the latest news articles related to a specific topic (e.g., technology, finance).
   - Display the article headlines and publication dates in your web application.

### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code

Below is the starter code to guide you through setting up the API connection. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```javascript
// Import Axios for making HTTP requests
const axios = require('axios');

// Define the API endpoint and your API key
const apiUrl = 'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines';
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

// Function to fetch news data
async function fetchNewsData() {
    try {
        // Make a GET request to the API
        const response = await axios.get(apiUrl, {
            params: {
                category: 'technology',
                apiKey: apiKey,
                country: 'us'
            }
        });
        
        // Extract and log the articles from the response
        const articles = response.data._______;
        articles.forEach(article => {
            console.log('Title:', article._______);
            console.log('Published At:', article._______);
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
}

// Call the function to fetch and display news data
fetchNewsData();
```

### Hints

- Ensure you have registered for an API key from NewsAPI and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual key.
- The response from the API is a JSON object. Familiarize yourself with its structure by logging it to the console.
- Pay attention to error handling by using `try-catch` blocks, which is crucial when dealing with external APIs.

### Expected Outcome

By completing this exercise, you will successfully set up a RESTful API connection to retrieve real-time news data. Your application should be able to dynamically display the latest headlines, demonstrating an understanding of real-time data integration techniques. Ensure your code is well-documented, adheres to best practices, and includes error handling to manage potential issues gracefully.

### Integration

This exercise is designed for easy integration into your learning platform. Use markdown formatting for clarity and provide any necessary resources or documentation links to enhance understanding. For further exploration, consider integrating this functionality into a three.js-based interactive globe visualization.
