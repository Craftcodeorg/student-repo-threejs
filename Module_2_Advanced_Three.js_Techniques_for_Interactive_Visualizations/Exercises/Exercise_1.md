### Exercise: Create a Complex Geometry with Multiple Materials

---

#### Problem Statement:

As a Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer interested in building interactive data visualizations, your task is to create a 3D model that represents a real-time financial data visualization dashboard using Three.js. You will design a complex geometry that reflects different market sectors and apply multiple materials to enhance its visual appeal. This exercise will help you apply advanced geometries and materials techniques discussed in the lecture to a practical scenario relevant to your career goals.

Your 3D model should:
- Use custom geometries to represent different market sectors.
- Apply multiple materials to differentiate between bullish and bearish trends.
- Implement texture mapping to add realism and detail to your models.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:

```javascript
// Import necessary Three.js modules
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Create a scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Define a custom shape for the market sector
const shape = new THREE.Shape();
shape.moveTo(0, 0);
shape.lineTo(0, 1);
shape.lineTo(1, 1);
shape.lineTo(1, 0);
shape.lineTo(0, 0);

// Extrude the shape to create a 3D geometry
const extrudeSettings = { depth: 0.5, bevelEnabled: false };
const geometry = new THREE.ExtrudeGeometry(shape, extrudeSettings);

// Apply a standard material with texture mapping for bullish trends
const bullishTexture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('path/to/bullish_texture.jpg');
const bullishMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ map: bullishTexture });

// Apply a basic material for bearish trends
const bearishMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });

// Choose material based on market condition
let material;
if (/* condition for bullish trend */) {
    material = _________;
} else {
    material = _________;
}

// Create a mesh with the geometry and selected material
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);

// Set up camera and renderer (fill in the blanks)
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = _______;

const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Render the scene
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    // Rotate the mesh for better visualization
    mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;
    mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

#### Hints:

1. **Geometry Creation**: Remember how custom shapes can be extruded into 3D geometries. Consider what shapes might best represent different market sectors.
   
2. **Material Application**: Think about how you can visually distinguish between bullish and bearish trends using color and texture. Review how textures are applied to materials in Three.js.

3. **Rendering Setup**: Ensure your camera is positioned correctly to view the entire scene. The `z` position of the camera should be set such that it can capture the full extent of your 3D model.

4. **Real-time Data Integration**: While this exercise focuses on static models, consider how you might later integrate real-time data to dynamically update the model's appearance based on market conditions.

#### Expected Outcome:

By completing this exercise, you should be able to create a visually compelling 3D financial data visualization that leverages advanced geometries and materials in Three.js. The final solution should include well-commented code that explains your design choices and demonstrates an understanding of how these techniques apply to real-world scenarios in data visualization. Your model should be dynamic, allowing for future integration with real-time data sources to reflect live market conditions.
