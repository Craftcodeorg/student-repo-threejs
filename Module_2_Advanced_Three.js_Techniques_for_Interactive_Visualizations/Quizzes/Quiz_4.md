### Quiz Questions ###

1. **QUESTION 1**: How can shaders be integrated into a Three.js project to optimize performance?
   - A) By using shaders to replace all geometry rendering
   - B) By leveraging shaders to reduce draw calls and manage complex visual effects efficiently
   - C) By using shaders only for lighting effects
   - D) By avoiding shaders as they decrease performance
   - **Correct Answer**: B) By leveraging shaders to reduce draw calls and manage complex visual effects efficiently

2. **QUESTION 2**: What is a primary advantage of using shaders in Three.js for performance optimization?
   - A) Shaders are easier to write than JavaScript
   - B) Shaders automatically compress textures
   - C) Shaders can offload complex calculations to the GPU, reducing CPU load
   - D) Shaders increase the number of draw calls
   - **Correct Answer**: C) Shaders can offload complex calculations to the GPU, reducing CPU load

3. **QUESTION 3**: In the context of Three.js, how do shaders contribute to reducing draw calls?
   - A) By merging all geometries into a single mesh
   - B) By allowing multiple objects to share the same material and rendering logic
   - C) By disabling frustum culling
   - D) By increasing the number of lights in the scene
   - **Correct Answer**: B) By allowing multiple objects to share the same material and rendering logic

### Quiz Purpose ###
- This quiz is designed to reinforce the learnerâ€™s understanding of how shaders can be integrated into Three.js projects for performance optimization, as discussed in the lecture "Performance Optimization Techniques". It ensures that learners can apply this knowledge in practical scenarios relevant to Data Visualization and their roles as Data Engineers and Full-Stack Developers.
