### Quiz Purpose ###

- This quiz is designed to reinforce the learnerâ€™s understanding of the content from the lecture "### Lecture: Integrating Shaders and Custom Materials." By focusing on the role of shaders in enhancing visual effects within Three.js, specifically in the context of adding shadows, learners will be able to apply shader integration techniques to create interactive and dynamic visualizations. This knowledge is crucial for Data Engineers and Full-Stack Developers aiming to develop advanced web-based applications with compelling data visualizations.
