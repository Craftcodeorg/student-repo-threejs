---

#### 1. Learning Objectives:
By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:
- Understand and implement advanced geometries in Three.js to create complex visualizations.
- Utilize various materials to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of 3D models.
- Integrate these techniques into data visualization projects, particularly for web-based applications.

#### 2. Introduction:
In the world of web development and data visualization, creating engaging and interactive 3D models can significantly enhance user experience. As a Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer, mastering advanced geometries and materials in Three.js will enable you to build sophisticated visualizations that can handle real-time data integration and complex datasets. This lecture will guide you through the essential techniques needed to elevate your web-based applications, making them more dynamic and visually appealing, which is crucial for applications like stock market analysis and geospatial data visualization.

#### 3. Core Concepts:

**A. Advanced Geometries:**
- **Custom Geometries:** Learn how to create custom shapes beyond basic primitives using `BufferGeometry`. This allows for more detailed and tailored visualizations that can represent complex datasets.
- **Extrusions and Lathe Geometries:** Explore techniques such as extrusion for creating 3D shapes from 2D outlines and lathe geometries for revolving shapes around an axis, useful in creating unique data representations.

**B. Materials:**
- **MeshBasicMaterial vs. MeshStandardMaterial:** Understand the differences and applications of basic versus standard materials, focusing on lighting and shading effects.
- **Texture Mapping:** Discover how to apply textures to materials to add detail without increasing geometric complexity, enhancing the realism of your models.

#### 4. Practical Application:

**Example 1: Financial Data Visualization**
Imagine a stock market dashboard where each stock is represented by a unique 3D shape. By using custom geometries, you can create shapes that reflect different market sectors or performance metrics. Applying textures can help differentiate between bullish and bearish trends visually.

**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
// Creating a custom geometry
const shape = new THREE.Shape();
// Define shape points
shape.moveTo(0, 0);
shape.lineTo(0, 1);
shape.lineTo(1, 1);
shape.lineTo(1, 0);
shape.lineTo(0, 0);

// Extrude the shape
const extrudeSettings = { depth: 0.5, bevelEnabled: false };
const geometry = new THREE.ExtrudeGeometry(shape, extrudeSettings);

// Apply material
const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
```

**Example 2: Geospatial Data Visualization**
For a global news visualization platform, use lathe geometries to create spinning globes or maps that display data points dynamically based on real-time inputs.

#### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, you explored advanced geometries and materials in Three.js, which are essential for creating interactive and visually appealing web-based applications. Understanding these concepts allows you to build sophisticated data visualizations that can engage users and provide deeper insights into complex datasets. As you progress in your career as a Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer, these skills will be invaluable in developing cutting-edge applications.

#### 6. Next Steps:
In the next lecture, we will delve into integrating Three.js with real-time data sources, enhancing your ability to create dynamic visualizations that update live with incoming data. To prepare, review basic JavaScript asynchronous programming concepts to better understand data fetching techniques.

Continue exploring Three.js documentation and experiment with different geometries and materials to solidify your understanding. This practice will prepare you for the upcoming topics and enhance your overall development skills.
