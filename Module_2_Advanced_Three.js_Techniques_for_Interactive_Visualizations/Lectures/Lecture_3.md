#### 3. Core Concepts:

- **Shaders in Three.js**: Shaders are programs that run on the GPU to control the rendering pipeline. In Three.js, shaders allow you to manipulate how objects are drawn, enabling effects like reflections, shadows, and custom lighting.

- **Types of Shaders**:
  - **Vertex Shaders**: Modify the position of vertices, essential for creating dynamic shapes and animations.
  - **Fragment Shaders**: Control the color and texture of pixels, crucial for achieving detailed surface effects.

- **Custom Materials**:
  - **Creating Custom Materials**: Learn how to use ShaderMaterial in Three.js to define custom shaders.
  - **GLSL Basics**: Understand the syntax and structure of GLSL to write effective shader programs.

- **Integrating Shaders with Data**:
  - Use shaders to visualize real-time data changes, such as fluctuating stock prices or evolving weather patterns.

#### 4. Practical Application:

**Example 1: Financial Data Visualization**
- Imagine a stock market dashboard where each stock's performance is visualized using a custom shader that changes color based on real-time data. A vertex shader can animate the height of bars representing stock prices, while a fragment shader adjusts colors from green to red based on performance.

**Code Snippet**:
```javascript
const vertexShader = `
  varying float height;
  void main() {
    height = position.y;
    gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
  }
`;

const fragmentShader = `
  varying float height;
  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = vec4(height / 10.0, 0.0, 1.0 - height / 10.0, 1.0);
  }
`;

const customMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
  vertexShader,
  fragmentShader
});
```

**Example 2: Geospatial Data Visualization**
- Use shaders to create heatmaps that dynamically change based on population density data, allowing for interactive exploration of geographical trends.

#### 5. Summary:

In this lecture, we explored how integrating shaders and custom materials in Three.js can significantly enhance your data visualizations. You learned about vertex and fragment shaders, how to write basic GLSL code, and how these concepts can be applied to real-world scenarios like financial and geospatial data visualization. These skills are vital for advancing your capabilities as a Data Engineer and Full-Stack Developer, enabling you to create visually stunning and interactive web applications.
